# digitalnotebookproject

This entire project was made for me to expand my coding abilities. I have been taking multiple courses in Javascript. But instead of making this from the bottom myself I have been using ChatGPT to see, how fast and how far it could take me with this idea.

This is therefore both an experiment for me in Javascript but also as to see, how far I can get with ChatGPT.

I'll put the milestones down here for me and others to see, how fast it went.
