This entire project was made for me to expand my coding abilities. I have been taking multiple courses in Javascript. But instead of making this from the bottom myself I have been using ChatGPT to see, how fast and how far it could take me with this idea.

This is therefore both an experiment for me in Javascript but also as to see, how far I can get with ChatGPT. 

I'll put the milestones down here for me and others to see, how fast it went.

```
*Note that I am a complete beginner, and i reckon some might say i should start somewhere else while learning Javascript. I probably should. Therefore you might also see some really bad rookie mistakes. Which is probably also why I should start somewhere else. I won't though. I also have a great interest in what and how i can use ChatGPT, so in this way I am able to combine two projects in one.*

### 3/4-2023: 
- Index.html, script.js and style.css
- Tried to add archive button and list

ChatGPT send me different variations of the javascript file, kept stopping itself while trying to print the whole javascript file. The above was made with ChatGPT 3.5, but it kept confusing itself. 

I tried switching to 4.0 and with a fresh slate, where i submitted the index and javascript file asking it for an archive button and a button that showed archived items.

- Submitted the files that worked fine from 3.5 and got a good response. Now the archive button is there, but it submits an entry twice - an empty entry and the entry with input.

My ability to spot, what and where something was wrong in the Javascript code that ChatGPT submitted increased already within the first hour.

**Total: About an hour**
